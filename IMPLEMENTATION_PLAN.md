# Upwork Go SDK - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a multi-phase approach to implementing a full-featured Upwork Go SDK with concurrent design patterns and Olympic-level programming standards.

## Phase 1: Core Foundation (Week 1)
### 1.1 Project Structure
- Set up Go module structure
- Create directory hierarchy:
  ```
  go-upwork/
  ├── api/           # API client implementations
  ├── auth/          # OAuth2 authentication
  ├── models/        # Data models and types
  ├── graphql/       # GraphQL query builders
  ├── errors/        # Custom error types
  ├── utils/         # Utility functions
  ├── examples/      # Usage examples
  └── tests/         # Test files
  ```

### 1.2 Authentication Module
- Implement OAuth2 client with all grant types
- Token management (storage, refresh, expiration)
- Service account support
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Concurrent request handling

### 1.3 GraphQL Client Foundation
- GraphQL query/mutation builder
- Response parser with generics
- Error handling framework
- Request interceptors for auth headers
- Context-based cancellation

## Phase 2: Core APIs (Week 2-3)
### 2.1 User & Organization Management
- User API: Current user, user details, lookup by email
- Organization API: Get org, list orgs, manage teams
- Company API: Company details, team management
- Staff management endpoints

### 2.2 Contracts & Offers
- Contract CRUD operations
- Offer management (create, withdraw, accept)
- Contract lifecycle (pause, end, restart)
- Milestone management
- Payment processing

### 2.3 Job Posting Management
- Create and update job postings
- Search marketplace jobs
- Job metadata and predictions
- Advanced filtering and pagination

## Phase 3: Communication & Collaboration (Week 4)
### 3.1 Messaging System
- Room management (create, list, archive)
- Message operations (send, receive, delete)
- Real-time subscriptions
- File attachments
- Room user management

### 3.2 Activities & Tasks
- Team activity management
- Task assignment and tracking
- Activity archiving
- Contract-activity linking

## Phase 4: Freelancer Features (Week 5)
### 4.1 Profile Management
- Profile CRUD operations
- Employment and experience records
- Skills and languages
- Availability settings
- Visibility controls

### 4.2 Proposals
- Submit proposals
- View and manage proposals
- Proposal metadata
- Direct upload links

## Phase 5: Analytics & Reporting (Week 6)
### 5.1 Work Diary & Time Tracking
- Work diary entries
- Screenshot management
- Time cell activities
- Manual time entries

### 5.2 Financial Reports
- Transaction history
- Billing reports
- Earnings reports
- Time reports by team/company

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Week 7)
### 6.1 GraphQL Subscriptions
- WebSocket client
- Subscription management
- Event handlers
- Reconnection logic

### 6.2 Metadata & Search
- Ontology APIs (categories, skills, occupations)
- Advanced search with filters
- Reference data caching
- Autocomplete support

## Phase 7: Production Readiness (Week 8)
### 7.1 Performance Optimization
- Connection pooling
- Request batching
- Response caching
- Concurrent request optimization

### 7.2 Testing & Documentation
- Unit tests (>90% coverage)
- Integration tests
- Performance benchmarks
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Best practices guide

## Phase 8: Advanced Patterns (Week 9)
### 8.1 Concurrent Design Patterns
- Worker pools for batch operations
- Pipeline pattern for data processing
- Fan-out/fan-in for parallel requests
- Circuit breaker for resilience

### 8.2 SDK Extensions
- CLI tool
- Middleware system
- Plugin architecture
- Custom transport layers

## Technical Requirements

### Core Dependencies
- Go 1.21+
- github.com/Khan/genqlient (GraphQL client generation)
- golang.org/x/oauth2 (OAuth2 support)
- github.com/gorilla/websocket (Subscriptions)
- github.com/stretchr/testify (Testing)

### Design Principles
1. **Idiomatic Go**: Follow Go best practices and conventions
2. **Type Safety**: Leverage Go's type system with generics
3. **Concurrency**: Built-in support for concurrent operations
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with context
5. **Testability**: Mockable interfaces and dependency injection
6. **Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput scenarios
7. **Documentation**: Detailed godoc for all public APIs

### Quality Standards
- 100% exported API documentation
- Minimum 90% test coverage
- Zero race conditions
- Benchmarks for critical paths
- Examples for all major features
- Semantic versioning

## Implementation Strategy

### Week-by-Week Breakdown
1. **Week 1**: Foundation and authentication
2. **Week 2-3**: Core APIs (users, contracts, jobs)
3. **Week 4**: Communication features
4. **Week 5**: Freelancer-specific features
5. **Week 6**: Analytics and reporting
6. **Week 7**: Advanced features and subscriptions
7. **Week 8**: Testing and documentation
8. **Week 9**: Performance optimization and advanced patterns

### Deliverables per Phase
- Fully tested module code
- API documentation
- Integration examples
- Performance benchmarks
- Migration guides (if applicable)

### Success Metrics
